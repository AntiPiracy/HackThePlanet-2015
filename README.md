# Hack The Planet 2015 - [Scurvy](http://devpost.com/software/scurvy-bgx3vm) - The Piracy-Proof Media Streaming Platform

Scurvy uses the art of [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography) to thwart pirates. The Scurvy Web App encrypts the name and email of the user into their videostream. The Scurvy Detect Pirates program continuously scans The Pirate Bay for videos in Scurvy's database, and if a video from Scurvy is found it automatically sends a "friendly" email to the pirate who posted the content. By going after the producers of pirated content rather than consumers (as current IP based anti-piracy measures do). Scurvy has the potential to destroy piracy at its roots.
